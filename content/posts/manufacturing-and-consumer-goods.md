Support the industry through our tools and our qualified team provide deeper insights.  It is known that supply chain risks remain a key source of uncertainty for manufacturers.  This is often made worse by volatility in tariff and trade policy, which can significantly impact the import of commodities and raw materials. Lack of the high-technology machines is a source of high number of product defects in Africa. This is compounded by high sub-standard raw materials can lead to lower quality finished products. It is noted that Africa lacks high-qualitied labour, which is often required to run todayâ€™s technologically advanced factories. Innovation in technology and automation present huge opportunities as well as risks to manufacturers. Internet-connected machinery, predictive maintenance, and automated inventory management are top priorities for manufacturing executives.
