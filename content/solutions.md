          Development and Goal Setting - Communicating What Matters**

          
          The journey to creating a high-performance organisation begins with a
          disciplined process for strategy development and goal setting and
          continues with communicating the strategy clearly through the

          strategy development and implementation. Most organisations have
          developed their strategies but always fail to execute them. Zenkos

          success is based on the understanding of the clients needs and
          applying the Balanced Scorecard Institute Methodology
